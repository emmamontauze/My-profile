     <h2>Double culture</h2>
     <p>
  	   I had the chance to grow up in a pluricultural environment between the french and the serbian culture. It helped me learn new languages more easily in my life so now I am proud to say I speak 4 languages🥳

     <h2>Fashion</h2>
     <p>
     	The fashion and luxury world has always had a huge importance in my life. It definitely is the area I've always wanted to grow professionally in. It's also why my website has for main topic the fashion world.👠
